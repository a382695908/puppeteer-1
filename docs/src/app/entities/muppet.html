Performed by Peter Linz, he is one of the central protagonists introduced in the film. During his adolescence, Walter frequently watched The Muppet Show, collecting memorabilia and finding the cast as a source of inspiration during his upbringing, which is why he often refers to himself as the \&quot;worldâ€™s biggest Muppet fan\&quot;. While on vacation in Los Angeles, Walter assists the Muppets in regaining both their popularity with the public and control of their acquired studios from oil baron Tex Richman. At the conclusion of the film, Walter deduces that he is a Muppet, adopts whistling as his sole talent and joins the group as their newest member.&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

Though she regularly performed vocals, she actually only sang lead a couple of times on the show. She also acted in sketches periodically, most notably as wisecracking Nurse Janice in \&quot;Veterinarian&#39;s Hospital\&quot;, a recurring parody of medical dramas. Her name is an homage to Janis Joplin. Janice is the band&#39;s lead guitar player, and she plays left-handed.

His name refers to the 20th century saxophonist Zoot Sims and per designer Bonnie Erickson, is modeled after Latin jazz artist Gato Barbieri. He is performed by Dave Goelz. He was conceived as a burned-out, depressed 50-year old musician, but according to Goelz, when the role was assigned to him, he did not know how to perform that type of character. He therefore made the character mainly communicate through his playing rather than by speaking.&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

He is named for his wild behavior and drumming. Some speculate the character is based on either Keith Moon or Levon Helm while others have suggested Mick Fleetwood. In the April 8, 2002, episode of Inside the Actors Studio, Billy Joel claimed that Liberty DeVitto was the inspiration for The Muppets character Animal, but most others say there is no evidence he was based on anyone.&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

Henson originally performed Kermit until his death in May 1990; Steve Whitmire has performed Kermit since that time.

Calm and wisecracking, his humor is characterized as deadpan and as such, is one of few Muppets who is rarely flustered by the show&#39;s prevalent mayhem.

She is a pig, specifically, a mangalitsa who is convinced she is destined for stardom, and nothing will stand in her way. She has a capricious nature, at times determined to convey an image of feminine charm, but suddenly flying into a violent rage (accompanied by her trademark karate chop and \&quot;hi-yah!\&quot;) whenever she thinks someone has insulted or thwarted her. Kermit the Frog is often the target of her alternating anger and affection. When not sending him flying through the air, she often smothers him in (usually unwanted) kisses. Frank Oz assigned hooks or personalities to each Muppet. Miss Piggy&#39;s hook was a \&quot;Truck driver wanting to be a woman\&quot;.&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

Bunsen is always eager to show off his latest scientific discovery, but his excitement about progress tends to render him short-sighted. Beaker usually ends up being harmed by Dr. Honeydew&#39;s inventions.
