# Puppeteer

Development stack to build web stuff using [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com
"Marionette.js â€“ A scalable and composite application architecture for
Backbone.js"). Some other funny names involved are:

* [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com "Gulp.js - The streaming build system")
* [CoffeeScript](http://gulpjs.com)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com "Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets")
* [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/ "The fun, simple, flexible Javascript test framework")
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com "Minimal Templating on Steroids")

## Caution

This is an extremely personal stack, with an extremely personal way of doing
things. I feel comfortable doing stuff this way, but I change my mind easily. So
if you have something to suggest, please do it. Fork it, change it, adapt it,
enlighten me with better ways of doing things.
